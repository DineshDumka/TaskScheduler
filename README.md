# Optimized Task Scheduling System with Web Integration (🚧 Ongoing Project 🚧)

## 🚀 Overview
The **Optimized Task Scheduling System** is a web-based application that efficiently assigns tasks to workers based on resource availability, priority, deadlines, and dependencies. The system implements **Priority Queues** for managing task prioritization, **Greedy Algorithms** for optimal task assignment, and **Graph Theory (Topological Sorting)** to handle task dependencies. 

This application provides an intuitive interface for users to **add, view, update, and track tasks in real time**. It is designed to handle **large datasets efficiently**, optimize resource utilization, and offer a **visual dashboard** for administrators to monitor task progress.

🚧 **This project is an ongoing development. Some features are still in progress and will be implemented soon. Stay tuned!** 🚧

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### **Prerequisites:**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- MongoDB (if using MongoDB)
- PostgreSQL (if using PostgreSQL)

### **Steps to Run the Project**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DineshDumka/TaskScheduler.git
   cd TaskScheduler
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Run the Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000/` 🚀
